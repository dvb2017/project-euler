# Project Euler

## Purpose
My current plan is for this repository to remain a continual work-in-progress.  I will work through problems on the Project Euler website, using this space to document my methodology and results.  If I come across any interesting topics to explore within a specific problem I will likely also provide some sort of commentary.  

## Structure
Although this is subject to change depending on how well the format functions, I will be structuring the repository in the following manner.  This README file will serve as a table of contents, linking to a folder for each completed or in progress problem.  These folders will each contain X elements, which I will briefly expand upon.  
1.  An individual README file, which will contain the bulk of the problem in order to provide context, the current status of the problem (completed or in progress), my methodology for solving the problem, and an answer if the problem is complete.  Additionally, I will include whatever commentary I may have regarding the specific problem, ranging from an explanation of a topic that it covers to describing a roadblock that I am currently facing in solving it.  
2.  A Jupyter notebook file containing my work.
3.  If necessary, any images or graphs associated with the problem will also be included in the folder so that they can be linked in the README file.
