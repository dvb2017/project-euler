# Project Euler

## Purpose
My current plan is for this repository to remain a continual work-in-progress.  I will work through problems on the Project Euler website, using this space to document my methodology and results.  If I come across any interesting topics to explore within a specific problem I will likely also provide some sort of commentary.  

## Structure
Although this is subject to change depending on how well the format functions, I will be structuring the repository in the following manner.  This README file will serve as a table of contents, linking to a folder for each completed or in progress problem.  These folders will each contain X elements, which I will briefly expand upon.  
1.  An individual README file, which will contain the text of the problem in order to provide context, the current status of the problem (completed or in progress), my methodology for solving the problem, and an answer if the problem is complete.  Additionally, I will include whatever commentary I may have regarding the specific problem, ranging from an explanation of a topic that it covers to describing a roadblock that I am currently facing in solving it.  These will all simply be named `README.md`
2.  A Jupyter notebook file containing my work.  Naming convention for this file will be `problem-x.ipynb`
3.  An image of the problem so that it can be included in the README.  These will be formatted as `problem-x.png`
I have also included a text file containing the template I will use for the README in future problem folders.  This may be updated to a folder later on if I end up using multiple templates.
